# d3vilh/openvpn-server
Fast a furious Docker container with OpenVPN Server living inside.

Testing in progress.

### Run this image using a `docker-compose.yml` file

```yaml
---
version: "3.5"

services:
    openvpn:
       container_name: openvpn
       image: d3vilh/openvpn-server:latest
       privileged: true
       ports: 
          - "1194:1194/udp"
       environment:
           TRUST_SUB: 10.0.70.0/24
           GUEST_SUB: 10.0.71.0/24
           HOME_SUB: 192.168.88.0/24
       volumes:
           - ./pki:/etc/openvpn/pki
           - ./clients:/etc/openvpn/clients
           - ./config:/etc/openvpn/config
           - ./staticclients:/etc/openvpn/staticclients
           - ./log:/var/log/openvpn
           - ./fw-rules.sh:/opt/app/fw-rules.sh
       cap_add:
           - NET_ADMIN
       restart: always
``` 
**Where:** 
* `TRUST_SUB` is Trusted subnet, from which OpenVPN server will assign IPs to trusted clients (default subnet for all clients)
* `GUEST_SUB` is Gusets subnet for clients with internet access only
* `HOME_SUB` is subnet where the VPN server is located, thru which you get internet access to the clients with MASQUERADE
* `fw-rules.sh` is bash file with additional firewall rules you would like to apply during container start

`docker_entrypoint.sh` will apply following Firewall rules:
```shell
IPT MASQ Chains:
MASQUERADE  all  --  ip-10-0-70-0.ec2.internal/24  anywhere
MASQUERADE  all  --  ip-10-0-71-0.ec2.internal/24  anywhere
IPT FWD Chains:
       0        0 DROP       1    --  *      *       10.0.71.0/24         0.0.0.0/0            icmptype 8
       0        0 DROP       1    --  *      *       10.0.71.0/24         0.0.0.0/0            icmptype 0
       0        0 DROP       0    --  *      *       10.0.71.0/24         192.168.88.0/24
``` 
Here is possible content of `fw-rules.sh` file to apply additional rules:
```shell
~/openvpn-server $ cat fw-rules.sh
iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.0.70.88 -d 10.0.70.77 -j DROP
iptables -A FORWARD -d 10.0.70.77 -s 10.0.70.88 -j DROP
```

Optionallt you can add [OpenVPN WEB UI](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui) container for managing server via GUI:
```yaml
    openvpn-ui:
       container_name: openvpn-ui
       image: d3vilh/openvpn-ui:latest
       environment:
           - OPENVPN_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
           - OPENVPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD=gagaZush
       privileged: true
       ports:
           - "8080:8080/tcp"
       volumes:
           - ./:/etc/openvpn
           - ./db:/opt/openvpn-gui/db
           - ./pki:/usr/share/easy-rsa/pki
       restart: always
```

### Run image with docker:
```shell
cd ~/openvpn-server/ && 
docker run  --interactive --tty --rm \
  --name=openvpn-server \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  -p 1194:1194/udp \
  -e TRUST_SUB=10.0.70.0/24 \
  -e GUEST_SUB=10.0.71.0/24 \
  -e HOME_SUB=192.168.88.0/24 \
  -v ./pki:/etc/openvpn/pki \
  -v ./clients:/etc/openvpn/clients \
  -v ./config:/etc/openvpn/config \
  -v ./staticclients:/etc/openvpn/staticclients \
  -v ./log:/var/log/openvpn \
  -v ./fw-rules.sh:/opt/app/fw-rules.sh \
  --privileged d3vilh/openvpn-server:latest
```

### Run the OpenVPN-UI image
```
docker run \
-v /home/pi/openvpn-server:/etc/openvpn \
-v /home/pi/openvpn-server/db:/opt/openvpn-gui/db \
-v /home/pi/openvpn-server/pki:/usr/share/easy-rsa/pki \
-e OPENVPN_ADMIN_USERNAME='admin' \
-e OPENVPN_ADMIN_PASSWORD='gagaZush' \
-p 8080:8080/tcp \
--privileged d3vilh/openvpn-ui:latest
```

### Build image form scratch:
```shell
docker build --force-rm=true -t local/openvpn-server .
```

### OpenVPN Server Pstree structure

All the Server and Client configuration located in mounted Docker volume and can be easely tuned. Full content [can be found here](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/tree/master/openvpn-server) and below is the tree structure:

```shell
|-- clients
|   |-- your_client1.ovpn
|-- config
|   |-- client.conf
|   |-- easy-rsa.vars
|   |-- server.conf
|-- db
|   |-- data.db //Optional OpenVPN UI DB

|-- staticclients //Directory where stored all the satic clients configuration
```

Most of documentation can be found in the [main README.md](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway) file, if you want to run it without anything else you'll have to edit the [dns-configuration](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn-server/config/server.conf#L20) (which currently points to the PiHole DNS Server) and
if you don't want to use a custom dns-resolve at all you may also want to comment out [this line](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn-server/config/server.conf#L39).

## Configuration

The volume container will be initialised  with included scripts to automatically generate everything you need on the first run:
 - Diffie-Hellman parameters
 - an EasyRSA CA key and certificate
 - a new private key
 - a self-certificate matching the private key for the OpenVPN server
 - a TLS auth key from HMAC security

Default EasyRSA configuration whoch can be changed in `~/openvpn-server/config/easy-rsa.vars` file, is the following:

```shell
set_var EASYRSA_DN           "org"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY  "UA"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE "KY"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY     "Kyiv"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_ORG      "SweetHome"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL    "sweet@home.net"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_OU       "MyOrganizationalUnit"
set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CN       "server"
set_var EASYRSA_KEY_SIZE     2048
set_var EASYRSA_CA_EXPIRE    3650
set_var EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE  825
set_var EASYRSA_CERT_RENEW   30
set_var EASYRSA_CRL_DAYS     180
```

In the process of installation these vars will be copied to container volume `/etc/openvpn/pki/vars` and used during all EasyRSA operations.
You can update all these parameters later with OpenVPN UI on `Configuration > EasyRSA vars` page.

This setup use `tun` mode, as the most compatible with wide range of devices, for instance, does not work on MacOS(without special workarounds) and on Android (unless it is rooted).

The topology used is `subnet`, for the same reasons. p2p, for instance, does not work on Windows.

The server config [specifies](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/openvpn/config/server.conf#L34) `push redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp`, meaning that after establishing the VPN connection, all traffic will go through the VPN. This might cause problems if you use local DNS recursors which are not directly reachable, since you will try to reach them through the VPN and they might not answer to you. If that happens, use public DNS resolvers like those of OpenDNS (`208.67.222.222` and `208.67.220.220`) or Google (`8.8.4.4` and `8.8.8.8`).

### Generating .OVPN client profiles with [OpenVPN WEB UI](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-ui)

**OpenVPN WEB UI** can be accessed on own port (*e.g. http://localhost:8080 , change `localhost` to your EC2's Public or Private IPv4 address*), the default user and password is `admin/gagaZush` preconfigured in `config.yml` which you supposed to [set in](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/blob/master/example.config.yml#L18) `ovpnui_user` & `ovpnui_password` vars, just before the installation.

Before client cert. generation you need to update the external IP address to your OpenVPN server in OVPN-UI GUI.

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/images/OVPN_ext_serv_ip1.png" alt="Configuration > Settings" width="350" border="1" />

And then update `"Server Address (external)"` field with your external Internet IP. Then go to `"Certificates"`, enter new VPN client name in the field at the page below and press `"Create"` to generate new Client certificate:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/images/OVPN_ext_serv_ip2.png" alt="Server Address" width="350" border="1" />  <img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/images/OVPN_New_Client.png" alt="Create Certificate" width="350" border="1" />

To download .OVPN client configuration file, press on the `Client Name` you just created:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/images/OVPN_New_Client_download.png" alt="download OVPN" width="350" border="1" />

If you use NAT and different port for all the external connections on your network router, you may need to change server port in .OVPN file. For that, just open it in any text editor (emax?) and update `1194` port with the desired one in this line: `remote 178.248.232.12 1194 udp`.
This line also can be [preconfigured in](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/example.config.yml#L23) `config.yml` file in var `ovpn_remote`.

Install [Official OpenVPN client](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/) to your client device.

Deliver .OVPN profile to the client device and import it as a FILE, then connect with new profile to enjoy your free VPN:

### Revoking .OVPN profiles

If you would like to prevent client to use yor VPN connection, you have to revoke client certificate and restart the OpenVPN daemon.
You can do it via OpenVPN WEB UI `"Certificates"` menue, by pressing Revoke red button:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/images/OpenVPN-UI-Revoke.png" alt="Revoke Certificate" width="600" border="1" />

Revoked certificates won't kill active connections, you'll have to restart the service if you want the user to immediately disconnect. It can be done via Portainer or OpenVPN WEB UI from the same `"Certificates"` page, by pressing Restart red button:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/raw/master/images/OpenVPN-UI-Restart.png" alt="OpenVPN Restart" width="600" border="1" />

### OpenVPN client subnets. Guest and Home users

[OpenVPN-AWS'](https://github.com/d3vilh/openvpn-aws/) OpenVPN server uses `10.0.70.0/24` **"Trusted"** subnet for dynamic clients by default and all the clients connected by default will have full access to your AWS Private subnet, as well as external Internet access with EC2 Public IP.
However you can be desired to share VPN access with your friends and restrict access to your AWS Private network for them (so they wont access OpenVPN-UI GUI or other services), but allow to use Internet connection with EC2 Public IP. This type of guest clients needs to live in special **"Guest users"** subnet - `10.0.71.0/24`:

To assign desired subnet policy to the specific client, you have to define static IP address for this client after you generate .OVPN profile.

> Keep in mind, by default, all the clients have full access, so you don't need to specifically configure static IP for your own devices, your home devices always will land to **"Trusted"** subnet by default. 

### CLI ways to deal with OpenVPN Server configuration

To generate new .OVPN profile execute following command. Password as second argument is optional:
```shell
sudo docker exec openvpn bash /opt/app/bin/genclient.sh <name> <IP> <?password?>
```

You can find you .ovpn file under `/openvpn/clients/<name>.ovpn`, make sure to check and modify the `remote ip-address`, `port` and `protocol`. It also will appear in `"Certificates"` menue of OpenVPN WEB UI.

Revoking of old .OVPN files can be done via CLI by running following:

```shell
sudo docker exec openvpn bash /opt/app/bin/revoke.sh <clientname>
```

Removing of old .OVPN files can be done via CLI by running following:

```shell
sudo docker exec openvpn bash /opt/app/bin/rmcert.sh <clientname>
```

Restart of OpenVPN container can be done via the CLI by running following:
```shell
sudo docker-compose restart openvpn
```

To define static IP, go to `~/openvpn/staticclients` directory and create text file with the name of your client and insert into this file ifrconfig-push option with the desired static IP and mask: `ifconfig-push 10.0.71.2 255.255.255.0`.

For example, if you would like to restrict Home subnet access to your best friend Slava, you should do this:

```shell
slava@Ukraini:~/openvpn/staticclients $ pwd
/home/slava/openvpn/staticclients
slava@Ukraini:~/openvpn/staticclients $ ls -lrt | grep Slava
-rw-r--r-- 1 slava heroi 38 Nov  9 20:53 Slava
slava@Ukraini:~/openvpn/staticclients $ cat Slava
ifconfig-push 10.0.71.2 255.255.255.0
```

> Keep in mind, by default, all the clients have full access, so you don't need to specifically configure static IP for your own devices, your home devices always will land to **"Trusted"** subnet by default.
